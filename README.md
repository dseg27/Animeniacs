## FINAL PROJECT

### PROPOSAL
Group Topic: Anime. We are pursuing this topic as we are subject-matter experts on Anime and have noticed increased popularity in Anime viewership recently. There is no well-known resource currently available to recommend new anime series or to quantify or forecast trends in anime, so weâ€™re stepping in to fill this need.

### Data Source: Kaggle CSVs

https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/hulu-movies-and-tv-shows 
https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows 
https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows

### Hypothesis:

We can use sentence embedding on anime and movie/show synopses to recommend animes, given someone's top five movies/shows.

### Analysis Approach:

We will use the Similarity Function (an area of supervised machine learning) to measure how similar synopses are. Reference: https://towardsdatascience.com/calculating-document-similarities-using-bert-and-other-models-b2c1a29c9630

### TECHNOLOGIES

Data Wrangling: Python, Pandas, etc.

Database: MongoDB

Machine Learning: NLP Model --> sentence embedding

Visualization: Maybe a Flask app, or GitHub Pages
