FINAL PROJECT 

## PROPOSAL 

Group Topic: Anime

Data Source: Kaggle CSVs

Hypothesis: We can use sentence embedding on anime and movie/show synopses to recommend animes, given someone's top five movies/shows.

Analysis Approach:
We will use the Similarity Function (an area of supervised machine learning) to measure how similar synopses are.
